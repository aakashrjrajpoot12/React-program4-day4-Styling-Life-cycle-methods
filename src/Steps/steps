Life Cycle methods
.....................
eg.i) componentWillUnmount()
component is removed from DOM
ii)componentDidMount()
component is added to DOM

features of life cycle
........................
*Automatically called
*if required ,then implement the appropriate life cycle method
*whether you implement or not they are called at different phase of life cycle


types of components
............................
class based 
function based
pure 
higher order




class based:
.................
-Mutable
-can overide the functionalities of lifecycle methods
-values can be passed either within the component or outside the component
-enhanced with context Api,redux
-explicitly inherit from React.component
-must overriding the render method
-aslo known as container or stateful components

function based
...................
-Immutable
-default from react >=16.8
-by-default you cann't use life cycle methods,context api,Redux
-values can be passed from outside component
-also k/w as stateless or presentation components

pure Component
...................
-subset of class based components
-will get rendered if and only if there are some changes on the components
-from react>=16.8 it can be represented both function based,class based
-optimizes the performance time
-returns an object or an array to re-render

Higher order Component(HOC)
.........................
-used to deploy common functionality across various components of the application
-used to reduce code redundancy
-HOC are function based components which takes component as argument and return component with added features.
